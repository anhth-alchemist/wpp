THE ALCHEMIST Social helps users identify devoted crypto educators with a proven track record of success who are worth following. For educators, tools are provided to help them manage their fan community and organize live streams, allowing them to earn extra income. We offer a number of structures/applications to enhance the user experience and promote a vibrant community.

* **News Feed** is the constantly updating list of stories in the middle of your home page. The Feed includes status updates, photos, videos, links, and reactions from people and groups that you follow on THE ALCHEMIST Social.&#x20;
* **Chat/Group** chat allows you to communicate privately with people or a group of people in real-time. Groups allow users to create communities of people who have similar interests or who live in the same area, and so on.&#x20;
* **Comments and Reactions** are structures that enable users to express their opinions and emotions. Users can tag people on their Friend List.
* **Friends** are fellow traders that users can connect with on THE ALCHEMIST. Adding a friend means users may see each other's activity in your News Feed.&#x20;
