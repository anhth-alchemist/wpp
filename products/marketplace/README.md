# Marketplace

The Marketplace is where users can rent/lease Trading Skill Books, which contain trading formulas developed by a top-performing investor and validated by THE ALCHEMIST’s operators. There are 3 roles for the actors in the Marketplace:

* ****[**Seeker**](../../our-team/our-team.md) **-** who rents the Trading Skill Books. They have no modification rights to the formulas provided by the Trading Skill Books. However, they have the power to submit reviews and report a Trading Skill Book.
* ****[**Alchemist**](../../our-team/our-team.md) - who leases the Trading Skill Books. They must have their trade history evaluated (they must have a rank higher than 1) and pass THE ALCHEMIST's trading knowledge exam. To publish a Trading Skill Book, a fee for validation must be paid in addition to the sale-related fees.
* **THE ALCHEMIST operator -** who is in charge of designing THE ALCHEMIST's trading knowledge exam, evaluating Lessors' qualifications, and adding/removing Trading Skill Books from the Marketplace.

## Why should the Alchemists rent their trading formulas?

The Seekers are not permitted to view the Formulae of the Trading Skill Books. They can only see potential coins and trading projections suggested by the Trading Skill Books. If a Seeker appreciates an Alchemist, the Seeker can follow the Alchemist’s account on THE ALCHEMIST Social.

As a result, not only does the Alchemist have a passive income stream, but they can also establish a community of people who admire, value, and follow their opinion, as well as have the opportunity to interact with other well-known figures or partner with potentially successful startups.

## **How does THE ALCHEMIST protect Seekers’ rights?**

Before being listed on the Marketplace, a Trading Skill Book must go through a rigorous vetting process. For the Alchemist, they must meet the following two key requirements: (1) Have a rank higher than 1 and (2) Pass the trading knowledge exam. Furthermore, their Trading Skill Books must be examined by THE ALCHEMIST operators and trading team. The process may take 2 - 4 weeks and the Alchemists must pay a fee for validation.&#x20;

When the Trading Skill Book is listed on the Marketplace, the Seeker can see the reviews, as well as the risk score, rate of return, and the number of copies sold. To ensure transparency, the risk score and rate of return are calculated using the Seeker's performance.&#x20;

Furthermore, Seekers can examine the profile of the Alchemists, such as their rankings, Capital Gain Rate, Average Profit per Order Rate, and Quantity of Orders. Please keep in mind that THE ALCHEMIST does not display the trading portfolio to protect the privacy of lessors.

If a Trading Skill Book receives a large number of negative reviews and reports, it will be temporarily withdrawn from the Marketplace and revalidated by the operators. Renters will be compensated if the Trading Skill Book/Course is permanently removed from the Marketplace.
