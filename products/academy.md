Crypto traders and enthusiasts are offered numerous educational sites. However, these existing sites have several problems. First, **users find it inconvenient to learn** as there is no specific learning path. Some sites do not divide their articles into levels based on users’ knowledge, posts are scattered throughout the sites, which makes navigating the necessary understanding of crypto and blockchain hard and exhausting. Secondly, **many sites do not provide in-depth articles** with factual examples about existing technical indicators. Thus, users can not learn about technical analysis easily and effectively. With the adoption still in its early stages, the world requires a user-friendly, and reliable source of information to increase awareness of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.&#x20;

And that is when THE ALCHEMIST Academy comes into the playground. THE ALCHEMIST Academy caters to users of all levels of experience, with content ranging from essential articles for novice traders to more sophisticated topics for the advanced. All articles are divided into levels, with an interactive learning path to bring beginner traders up to speed. To further build the community and drive cryptocurrency awareness and adoption, The Alchemist works closely with our qualified and experienced [Alchemist](../our-team/our-team.md) to develop educational materials and Course certification programs.&#x20;

For[ Seekers](../our-team/our-team.md), The Alchemist has dedicated a branch called "Free Learning". In this branch, Seekers can join the system's Free Courses or our Partner’s Courses and receive product trial packages. Especially, when completing certain courses continuously or relatively difficult courses, users will receive Alchemist Tokens.
