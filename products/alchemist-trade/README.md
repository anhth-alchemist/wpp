# Alchemist Trade

## **What is Alchemist Trade?**

Cryptos displayed on Al-Trade are detected based on customizable algorithms, which are built using trading formulae.

&#x20;A trading formula is a set of mathematical instructions that define a trader's trading strategy. These [settings](trading-formula.md) include Indicator Combination, Timeframe, Entry Point, Target Point, Dollar-Cost Averaging Point 1, Dollar-Cost Averaging Point 2, Stop-loss Point, Risk, Reward, and Candlestick-pattern Formula.

* Using the combination of technical indicators, the Al-Trade displays suitable trading pairs and notifies users when a trading pair meets specific trading strategy requirements.
* Trading pairs displayed on Al-Trade are detected based on our price movement detection algorithm.
* Our data are imported from Binance, and we aim to expand our sources to include Coinbase, MEXC, Huobi, etc.
* Users can either follow the recommendations from Al-Trade or[ modify/create](my-formula.md) their own trading formulas.
