# Trading Formula



A trading formula is a set of mathematical instructions that define a trader's trading strategy.&#x20;

We discovered through thorough experiments and testing that the following settings are the most fundamental and have defined them as such:

* **Indicator Combination:** A confluence of multiple trading signals.&#x20;
* **Time Frame:** The amount of time that a trend lasts in a market. Currently, The Alchemist currently has four time frame options: 1D (1 day), 4H (4 hours), 1H (1 hour), and 30M. (30 minutes).
* **Entry Point:** Refers to the price at which an investor buys or sells a security.&#x20;
* **Target Point:** A price level set at the initiation of a trade at which point the trader will exit for a gain.&#x20;
* **DCA Points 1 and 2:** Buy or Sell price points recommended by Al-Trade, based on the Dollar-cost averaging strategy.&#x20;
* **Stop-loss Point:** A price level to sell an asset when it reaches a particular price point to limit loss in a trade.&#x20;
* **Risk:** The probability of losing part or all of the initial investment.&#x20;
* **Reward:** The total potential profit, established by a profit target.
* **Candlestick-pattern Formula:** Formulas developed and tested by The Alchemist for calculating candlestick patterns. These settings are defined by specific inputs or formulae
