## Abstract



> THE ALCHEMIST is a new type of social network and charts analysis platform that aims to revolutionize technical trading and advance investors' financial education. Our technology enables users to create their trading algorithm and turn any strategy into a Price Prediction Bot, without having to know how to code. The bot automatically searches for and only displays cryptocurrencies that match users’ desired technical conditions. We liberate people's finances and assist traders in increasing their hard-won capital based on analysis powered by algorithms, formulas, and mathematics. All the external factors, including bias, emotion, social influence, FOMO, and other costly analysis mistakes, are removed from traders’ routines. In addition, we also provide a Marketplace for people to lend/rent Trading Skill Books or sell/buy online Courses, a social network for sharing, connecting, and learning, and various constructions promoting a dynamic community.&#x20;

> Our motto is "All for Traders". We are built by and for the community. We do not just provide crypto analytics; we want to encourage our users to learn, earn, and put their newfound knowledge to the test.&#x20;

> At The Alchemist, we believe in the power of data and knowledge to bring clarity to our increasingly volatile market. By putting cutting-edge technology and information resources in the hands of more people, we empower them to make better, more informed decisions, build a long-lasting platform, and help millions of traders and investors.
